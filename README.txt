Hey Mr.

Its a simple C program.
To run this make sure you have required class/section files in the same folder as that of main.
Sample output image is also in the folder.

You can contat me anytime for any kind of queries.

If you are satisfied with the task then a honest review will be appreciated & dont forget to refer me to your friends.
It was great experience working with you.
Thank You & Happy Coding!
